Morveux
#######

THIS IS CURRENTLY BETA AND COULD KILL KITTENS. TAKE CARE.

The idea behind morveux is to have a TCP proxy which sometimes choses to drop
packets, add delays and sometimes choses toâ€¦ just work.

This is useful to test that your applications are able to handle possible
errors on your stack, and are resilent to them.
